# TeamBuilder

Build and display a team including the team manager and team members

## Project Description

This application was developed to quickly generate a team and employees. Each teams consists of a manager and any combination of engineers and interns. It uses the inquirer package provided by NPM to lead the user through a series of prompts that enable the user to define the team manager, as many engineers and as many interns as needed. When the user is finished adding members to the team, an html page is generated with a list of the team members and their information.
